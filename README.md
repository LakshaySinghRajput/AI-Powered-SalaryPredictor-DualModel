This project uses an AI-driven dual-model approach to accurately predict the minimum and maximum salary range for job listings based on features like job title, category, and location. Leveraging machine learning and smart feature engineering, this model provides a powerful tool for both candidates and recruiters to estimate market compensation more precisely.
